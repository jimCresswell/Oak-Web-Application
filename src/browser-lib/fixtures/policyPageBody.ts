<h2>2. The personal data we hold</h2>
<p>
  The personal information that we will collect about you falls into
  the following categories:
</p>
<h3>Information collected automatically by our website</h3>
<p>
  Our website collects some limited information about you
  automatically when you visit the site using your electronic device
  (this could be a computer desktop, laptop, phone, tablet,
  television). We do not seek to identify you from this information
  or do anything with it that will affect you individually. To the
  extent practicable, we aggregate and/or remove anything that could
  be used to identify you from this information before we use it,
  including (where possible) anonymising IP (Internet Protocol)
  addresses.
</p>
<p>This information includes, or may in the future include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the IP address from which you access our website;</li>
  <li>
    information about the device used to access the site (including
    the number of pupils using it);
  </li>
  <li>your approximate location;</li>
  <li>your school;</li>
  <li>
    the pages that you click on our site, including the lessons that
    you view (and therefore your likely year group);
  </li>
  <li>
    the time that you spend on the site and the time that you spend
    viewing videos on the site;
  </li>
  <li>
    the website uses cookies and web beacons. Please see the{" "}

      Oak Cookie Policy
    </a>{" "}
    for full details.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Information that you input to our website</h3>
<p>
  Some pages on our website invite you to input information about
  yourself – for example, where we invite you to sign up to receive
  an e-newsletter from us, or to provide feedback through a survey.
  In those cases the information sought is clear on the relevant
  page.
</p>
<p>
  We also ask teachers to input their school name on some pages,
  and, in particular, in order to download our resources.
</p>
<h3>
  Information that you send to us by email or other electronic means
</h3>
<p>
  You may also send us information about yourself by email or other
  electronic means (for example, through Facebook or Twitter). In
  that case we will record your name and basic contact details and,
  of course, the information that you include in your communication.
</p>
<p>
  When we invite you to provide information about yourself, it is
  entirely up to you whether you give us the information or not.
  Often, however, we will not be able to do something that you are
  asking for (for example, send you an e-newsletter, or respond to
  an enquiry) if you do not give us the information.
</p>
<h3>Information collected through the Teacher Hub</h3>
<p>
  If you are using the Teacher Hub (

  ) and Teacher Hub (

    teachers.thenational.academy
  </a>
  ) to enable users to submit a feedback form to report a technical
  bug or error in a lesson, make a general enquiry or to share
